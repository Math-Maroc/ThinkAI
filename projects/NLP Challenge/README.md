# NLP Challenge

The goal of this challenge is to train a language model useful to moroccans. It can be as generic as pretraining a model on a large Moroccan corpus or as specific as fine-tuning a model on a downstream task such as text summarization, translation, question-answeringâ€¦ Pariticipants also had to train/fine-tune a model, and present a useful use case.

Source code and documentation are provided in original GitHub repositories of the participants.
